A simple parser to parse some URLs of facebook

# Usage

You have to login facebook first.

## The first block

Due to the algorithm of facebook, it won't show all posts from pages.

But you could get all of them from RSS.

Just copy and paste the link of the page to the text field.

It will show you the result url of RSS.

Once you have the RSS link, you can use your RSS Reader to follow the pages your like.

## The second block

I made this for fun, and I don't know to explain too much.

Try it yourself. XD
